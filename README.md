Artificial Neural Networks (Project Part 3 of 3)

# Problem

Continue from Milestone 2 to build a simple neural netwok, a DNN & a RNN model and compare performance.

# Abstract:

The capstone project focuses on diaper manufacturing quality. Generally, to ensure or predict quality, a diaper manufacturer need s to monitor every step of the manufacturing process with sensors such as heat sensors, glue sensors, glue level, etc.
For this capstone project, we will use the SECOM manufacturing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Summary from Milestone 01 & Milestone 02


### Data Formatting
- **Merging Data**
- **Missing Data**
- **Repeated Values (Columns with the same value)**


### Feature Selection

### Analysis
- **Normalizing features from 0-1**
- **Split Data and Class Imbalance**
    - Split Data
    - Class Imbalance
- **Simple Neural Network**
- **Deep Neural Network**
- **Recurrent Neural Network**

### Summary of Models Performance
